# Reference

My biggest reference was the AAA game CSGO, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - First of all, I've created my widget and imported an unreal character.

2.0 - After that, I've made a SceneCapture2D camera to pass the 3D model for the widget. And then, I've made a texture target together with a material of this texture.

2.1 - So, I positioned the camera and the model and, configured the texture target and its material.

2.2 - And, in the widget, I made an image and in the brush, I've put the material of the texture target.

3.0 - For the finish, I just modified, a little, my widget according to the CSGO reference and configured some stuff.
